## Notes

This was my very first app and the first time I used swift, but overall i am very pleased with it.  I had trouble formatting the total amount to look like currency, but it taught me new swift classes.  I also had trouble with animating the segment control and the ui color scheme, but I really like how xcode has the phone view and allows you to make changes to the UI without coding everything.

I really enjoyed the tutorial though and am looking forward to the course!!
